## In Progress Tasks
*None*

## Upcoming Tasks (Sprint 3)
- [ ] Task 12: Correctness Agent Adapter

## Gaps, Issues, and Risks
- **Google ADK integration**: High dependency risk. Mitigated by Orchestrator abstraction seam allowing a plain Python fallback.
- **Claude debate loop complexity**: High token/time risk. Mitigated by deterministic baseline running first and debate acting as a strict cuttable upgrade.
- **Secret leaks**: Checked system-wide using a single `RedactionContext`.
- **Commit window constraints**: Mandatory check for author/commit timestamps ≥ 2026-06-17.
